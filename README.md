## Hi!

My name's Madurya, and I'm a recent graduate from **UCLA** with a B.A. in **Linguistics and Computer Science**. 🗣️👩🏽‍💻

Now, I'm doing my **Masters in Computer Science at UCSD**! 🤖🪼

I'm currently working on a research project for the Computing Education lab at UCSD, where I will be porting an Android app written in Java, aimed to help students manage procrastination, to a React Native iOS app. 

I'm interested in software development (web and app), user experience, programming languages/compilers, and natural language processing. 

Check out my most recent project I did for my NLP class at UCSD [here](https://github.com/3madurya3/cse256_finalproject), where I fine-tuned Wav2Vec for Automatic Speech Recognition on a dataset of second-language English speakers.

For my most recent (public) app dev work, check out the [app](https://github.com/3madurya3/pocketpets) I made for a hackathon last school year.

Also, I worked as a programmer research assistant at the Speech and Cognitive Development lab at UCLA last year. I'm super proud of [this project](https://github.com/megseekosh/everyday_speech/tree/main), which was used for results and analysis for thousands of hours of speech audio data in an academic paper. Check out the script I wrote called *0_custom_epoch.py* -- I had come up with my own greedy algorithm to process the data after learning about greedy algorithms in my CS class!

Feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madurya/) if you are interested in something I've worked on, or want to work on something together!
