## Hi!

My name's Madurya, and I'm a recent graduate from **UCLA** with a B.A. in **Linguistics and Computer Science**.

Now, I'm doing my **Masters in Computer Science at UCSD**!

I'm currently working on a research project for the Computing Education lab at UCSD, where I will be porting an Android app written in Java, aimed to help students manage procrastination, to a React Native iOS app. 

I'm interested in software development (web and app), user experience, programming languages/compilers, and natural language processing. 

Check out my most recent project I did for my NLP class at UCSD [here](https://github.com/3madurya3/cse256_finalproject).
For my most recent (public) app dev work, check out the [app](https://github.com/3madurya3/pocketpets) I made for a hackathon last school year.

In my free time, I like to:
- listen to and make music 💿
- boulder 🧗🏽‍♀️
- watch TV... :)

Feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madurya/) if you are interested in something I've worked on, or want to work on something together!
